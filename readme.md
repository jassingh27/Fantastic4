# SIT329 - Advanced Embedded System
## Team: FANTASTIC FOUR 
## Team Members: Jasdeep Singh, Chelsea Dore, Jayamini De Silva, Aashritha Chakilam

### Introduction: 
Our project aims to develop an FPGA-based live tracking system for Public Transport Victoria (PTV) vehicles. The system will provide real-time vehicle location updates, estimated arrival times, and user-friendly visualisation to enhance passenger experience.
Our system’s key features include:
• Real-time tracking of PTV vehicles (For our project case, we will be monitoring one bus)
• Display vehicle locations on a map interface.
• Arrival time estimation for specific stops.
• User-friendly web interface for passengers.

### Tools:

#### Hardware:
• FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Arrays)
• U-blox NEO-6M GPS Module

#### Software:
• Quartus [Download Quartas](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/programmable/support-resources/programming/tls-software.html)
• U-blox NEO-6M GPS Module
